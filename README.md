# **Contact App** 

I built this website to the people for storing their contacts details.
In the Contacts app , you can view and edit your contacts lists from personal, business, and other accounts. You can also create contacts and set up a contact card with your own information.

[You can try it here on the live website!](https://contactapp.herokuapp.com/)

   * But for bottom I used specifice colors like:
      * Green for submit.
      * Light blue for Edit.
      * Red for delete.
   
## _**Technology Used**_
* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/ "Django Project website")
    - Django was used to build the models, forms and views of the app, and was the backbone of this project.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/ "Bootstrap")
     - Bootstrap was used to implement the responsiveness of the site, using bootstrap classes, but also other styling such as buttons etc.
* [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/ "Cloudinary")
     - Cloudinary was used as free cloud storage for images uploaded to the site through the recipe forms.
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts")
    - Google fonts were used to import the fonts "Playfair Display" and "Lato" into the style.css file. These fonts were used throughout the project.
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/ "FontAwesome")
     - Font Awesome was used on all pages throughout the website to import icons (e.g. social media icons) for UX purposes.
* [GitPod](https://git-scm.com/ "GitPod")
     - Git was used for version control by utilizing the GitPod terminal to commit to Git and push to GitHub.
* [GitHub](https://github.com/ "Link to GitHub")
     - GitHub was used to store the project after pushing
* [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/ "ElephantSQL Database")
    - ElephantSQL was used to the new database instead of the Heroku's Postgres


# Deployment
## Set up ElephantSQL as Database for this application ##

  - Install the Cloudinary Python library by running the following command:

        pip install cloudinary

  - Add cloudinary in INSTALLED_APPS list in settings.py
  - Add the following code to your Django settings file to configure the Cloudinary library with your account credentials:

    ```
      STATIC_URL = '/static/'
      STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.StaticHashedCloudinaryStorage'
      STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static'),]
      STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')

      CLOUDINARY_STORAGE = {
          'CLOUD_NAME': os.environ.get('CLOUD_NAME'),
          'API_KEY': os.environ.get('API_KEY'),
          'API_SECRET': os.environ.get('API_SECRET'),
      }
      
      MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
      DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'
    ```

    ```
        python manage.py migrate
    ```
